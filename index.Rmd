# Location & Climate
<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; justify-content: space-between;">

  <!-- 文本部分 -->
  <div style="width: 55%; text-align: left;">
    <p>Singapore is located near the <span style="color:#FF5733;"> equator </span> and experiences a <span style="color:#FF5733;"> tropical rainforest climate</span>, with high temperatures and humidity year-round (typically 26-34°C).</p>
    <p>Due to its equatorial location, Singapore receives <span style="color:#FF5733;"> intense solar radiation </span> throughout the year, making it inherently prone to <span style="color:#FF5733;"> high urban temperatures</span>.</p>

#Problem statement
* Studies indicate that urban temperatures in Singapore are <span style="color:#FF5733;">4-7°C higher</span> than in rural areas, with the most significant UHI effects occurring at night.

* The most affected areas include the *CBD, Kallang-Geylang region, and industrial zones* (Chatterjee et al., 2019).

* Research also shows that night time surface temperatures in Singapore are higher than daytime temperatures due to <span style="color:#FF5733;">heat retention by buildings and roads, which slowly release stored heat overnight</span> (Wong & Chen, 2009).

#Heat Vulnerability Assessment

1. Calculate the mean values of NDVI and LST for each planning area.

2. Normalize all indicators using <span style="color:#FF5733;"> Min-Max scaling</span>. For indicators negatively correlated with heat vulnerability (e.g., NDVI), use the transformed value (1 – NDVI').
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',out.width='30%'}
knitr::include_graphics("formula1.png")
```

3. Assume equal contribution of all variables to heat vulnerability (<span style="color:#FF5733;">all variables have equal weights</span>). Sum all normalized variables to obtain the Urban Heat Vulnerability (UHV) index.
