###Singapore suffers from the persistent Urban Heat Island effect, leading to rising health risks, soaring energy consumption, and worsening environmental degradation.

#Location & Climate
* Singapore is located near the <span style="color:#1C5FA3;">**equator**</span>  and experiences a <span style="color:#1C5FA3;">**tropical rainforest climate**</span>, with high temperatures and humidity year-round (typically 26-34°C). 
* Due to its equatorial location, Singapore receives <span style="color:#1C5FA3;">**intense solar radiation**</span> throughout the year, making it inherently prone to <span style="color:#1C5FA3;">**high urban temperatures**</span>.

#Problem statement
* Studies indicate that urban temperatures in Singapore are 4-7°C higher than in rural areas, with the most significant UHI effects occurring at night.

* The most affected areas include the CBD, Kallang-Geylang region, and industrial zones (Chatterjee et al., 2019).

* Research also shows that nighttime surface temperatures in Singapore are higher than daytime temperatures due to heat retention by buildings and roads, which slowly release stored heat overnight (Wong & Chen, 2009).
