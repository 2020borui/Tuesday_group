  <div style="width: 55%; text-align: left;">
    <p>Singapore is located near the <span style="color:#FF5733;"> equator </span> and experiences a <span style="color:#FF5733;"> tropical rainforest climate</span>, with high temperatures and humidity year-round (typically 26-34°C).</p>

#Problem statement
* Studies indicate that urban temperatures in Singapore are <span style="color:#FF5733;">4-7°C higher</span> than in rural areas, with the most significant UHI effects occurring at night.

* The most affected areas include the *CBD, Kallang-Geylang region, and industrial zones*.

* Research also shows that night time surface temperatures in Singapore are higher than daytime temperatures due to <span style="color:#FF5733;">heat retention by buildings and roads, which slowly release stored heat overnight</span> (Wong & Chen, 2009).

#**Why this topic？**
####Climate warming and its resulting urban heat island is an issue of global concern to which the Singapore government attaches particular importance.    
#**Why Singapore？**
####Singapore is a highly urbanized and heat-prone city, making it an ideal case for studying urban heat mitigation. Taking Singapore as a starting point, we can also provide inspiration and assistance to other cities or countries in solving the problem of urban heat island effect.

.panel[.panel-name[NUA]
[The New Urban Agenda(NUA)](https://unhabitat.org/sites/default/files/2019/05/nua-english.pdf) provides a global framework for sustainable urban development. It promotes sustainable urbanization by integrating resilience, planning, and environmental sustainability.   

1.3.2 Resilience and adaptation to climate change (NUA 80,NUA 67)  

1.3.3 Climate change mitigation(NUA 143,NUA 79)  

The NUA emphasizes integrating climate resilience into planning. Urban heat mitigation is a key component of such integration, particularly for tropical high-density cities like Singapore.

#Limitations 
While Singapore’s national plans show strong ambition in urban greening and cooling, several **implementation gaps** may hinder full alignment with global development goals:

**1. Social Equity**  
- Vulnerable groups (low-income, elderly, outdoor workers) remain at higher heat risk.  
- Equity must be central in climate adaptation strategies.

**2. Public Engagement**  
- Limited community awareness and weak incentives for sustainable practices reduce participation in urban cooling efforts.

**3. Adaptive Governance**  
- Need for regular evaluation and long-term monitoring of urban heat mitigation measures.

#Heat Vulnerability Assessment

1. Calculate the mean values of NDVI and LST for each planning area.

2. Normalize all indicators using <span style="color:#FF5733;"> Min-Max scaling</span>. For indicators negatively correlated with heat vulnerability (e.g., NDVI), use the transformed value (1 – NDVI').
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',out.width='30%'}
knitr::include_graphics("formula1.png")
```

3. Assume equal contribution of all variables to heat vulnerability (<span style="color:#FF5733;">all variables have equal weights</span>). Sum all normalized variables to obtain the Urban Heat Vulnerability (UHV) index.

The project is scheduled to be completed over 9 months and consists of five phases: initiation, planning, execution, control, and closure. 

The interventions include tree planting, green roofs, bus-only lanes, cycling infrastructure, car-free zones, and reflective coatings. Public welfare measures will focus on community shade structures, drinking water stations, and subsidies for the elderly, low-income groups, and outdoor workers. A mid-term evaluation will assess progress and make necessary adjustments to optimize outcomes.

#Summary  

Mitigating urban heat and enhancing heat resilience requires coordinated, multi-level actions across sectors. This includes combining nature-based solutions, infrastructure improvements, smart technologies, and policy measures. Equally important are social protection efforts for vulnerable groups such as the elderly, low-income communities, and outdoor workers.  

Together, these strategies can effectively reduce urban temperatures, improve thermal comfort, and strengthen climate resilience, while also enhancing the city’s livability and sustainability.
